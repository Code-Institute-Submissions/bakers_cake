## 9. Testing <a name="Testing"></a>

### Code Validation

- Python - All code was run through [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) and the [SolarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) plugin for VSCode was used. All code is PEP8 compliant.

- HTML - All code was run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure it was valid code and no errors were made.
 
- CSS - All styling was run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure it was valid and no errors were made.

- jQuery - All my script was run through the [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validator and no errors were found.


### Manual Testing

I have extensively tested the site manually, making sure all the links and features works.
You can view the testing done in the [test.md](https://github.com/Dhracko/bakers_cake/blob/master/static/readme_docs/testing/test.md)

### Testing against user Story

For User story testing please refer to the [user_story_testing.md](https://github.com/Dhracko/bakers_cake/blob/master/static/readme_docs/testing/user_story_testing.md.md)

### Automated Testing

On top of the manual testing, I created automated testing for the 3 main apps with a total of 15 testing, following the advice of the short section at The Code Institute.

The code are included:
* Products > tests.py: Product form testing and Product page view test.
* Checkout > tests.py: Order form testing
* Contact > tests.py: Contact form testing


### Issues and resolutions <a name="Issues"></a>
 
* During the automated testing, I realised I set the postcode input value to "blank=True" but it's necessary for the card payment, to I changed to "False".
* In order to make the automated testing works I had to temporally remove the remote database.
