## 1. Aim of the site <a name="Aim"></a>

The Client has a small business where they bake cakes for local clients and now, they are ready to take it a step further and
expand the business to an online retail system where they can sell the cake to online customers anywhere within the UK and Channel Islands.

All the cakes are homemade and bake to order only using natural high quality ingredients with no artificial preservatives.

There is a repertoire of cakes and cake samples from previous orders for the users choose from and get ideas for their needs and a form where the users
can contact the shop owner to request a specific cake.

Due to the nature of the cakes baked fresh, the client will only dispatch to the UK and Channel Islands. All the cakes will be sent on a priority 
shipping, next day delivery.

## 2. UX <a name="UX"></a>

As the company is a small local based and the existing client base is small.
The main aim is to expand the company with shoppers and users with the following criteria:

1. Based within the UK & Channel Islands.
2. Are looking for home bake style cakes.
3. They want a choice of which type of cake is made of.
4. Likes to leave feedback from their experience and cake purchase.

To help this business to stand out from other online, the website needs to ensure that:
* Is easy to use and navigate
* Don't overload the user with too many 'walls of text'.
* Reminds the user to leave feedback from their product purchase to help other users.
* Is easy to track down the previous orders purchased.
* A rating system for users to rate cakes.
* Reviews left by other users who purchase the cakes before.

## 3. User Stories <a name="Users"></a>

User Stories were created using a spreadsheet for easier tracking on development and better description.

The Users Stories can be found [here](https://github.com/Dhracko/bakers_cake/blob/master/static/readme_docs/user_stories.pdf)

## 5. Wireframes Mockups: <a name="Wireframes"></a>
Mockups of the website was made using [Balsamiq Wireframe](https://balsamiq.com/) to see how it would look for the different platforms like on large screens such as desktops and 
 on small screens such as a mobile phone:
