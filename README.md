## 5. Wireframes Mockups: <a name="Wireframes"></a>
Mockups of the website was made using [Balsamiq Wireframe](https://balsamiq.com/) to see how it would look for the different platforms like on large screens such as desktops and 
 on small screens such as a mobile phone:

## 7. Future Goals <a name="Future"></a>

* Other register users can click on like or dislike a review left from other users.
* A posibility of collection instead of delivery.
* Admin can select to see only reviews done by a specific user.

---

## 8. Schema Design

I created the schema in 6 different part after taking in consideration all de different parts of the website:

* user_profile: These are the details that the user saves to their profile for quick checkouts in the future. The username, email address and password details are set when the user registers for the site, and the delivery details are added when the user makes a purchase and selects to save those details to their profile.

* order: This includes the overall order in full, including the delivery details from (from or added to the user profile) and the order_line_items.

* order_line_items: This includes details of each product the user orders, the details of each product are linked to the products section.

* products: This includes all the information related to each product, including the product item price, SKU, image, name, descriptions, category and rating. Products can only be added by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

* category: Linking to the category field in the products section, the Category model simply holds the categories which are chosen in the product model. These categories are pre-set and can only be modified or added to by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

* review: This will link to product. With this being linked to products so the review will only show on the product that is being linked to. Also a future feature where Admin can see the reviews done by a specific user. This can be added by any user but not modified.

## 10. Testing <a name="Testing"></a>

### Code Validation

- Python - All code was run through [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) and the [SolarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) plugin for VSCode was used. All code is PEP8 compliant.

- HTML - All code was run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure it was valid code and no errors were made.
 
- CSS - All styling was run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure it was valid and no errors were made.

- jQuery - All my script was run through the [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validator and no errors were found.


### Manual Testing

I have extensively tested the site manually, making sure all the links and features works.
You can view the testing done in the [test.md](static/readme_docs/testing/test.md)

### Testing against user Story

For User story testing please refer to the [user_story_testing.md](https://github.com/Dhracko/bakers_cake/blob/master/static/readme_docs/testing/user_story_testing.md.md)

### Automated Testing

On top of the manual testing, I created automated testing for the 3 main apps with a total of 15 testing, following the advice of the short section at The Code Institute.

The code are included:
* Products > tests.py: Product form testing and Product page view test.
* Checkout > tests.py: Order form testing
* Contact > tests.py: Contact form testing


### Issues and resolutions <a name="Issues"></a>
 
* During the automated testing, I realised I set the postcode input value to "blank=True" but it's necessary for the card payment, to I changed to "False".
* In order to make the automated testing works I had to temporally remove the remote database.
